# Housekeeping bug-batch (bug-109/110/111/112/113) — work-trace

**Scope:** Director-directed housekeeping sweep (2026-05-22) — squash the five
post-mission-86 housekeeping bugs.
**Engineer:** greg
**Coordination:** thread-608 (architect lily; the coordination spine for the batch)
**correlationId:** `housekeeping-2026-05-22`

## The batch

| Bug | Sev | PR | Summary |
|-----|-----|----|---------|
| bug-110 | minor | PR-1 | `vitest (hub)` flaky — pg connection open at testcontainer teardown → unhandled `57P01` |
| bug-111 | major | PR-2 | `get-agents.sh` defaults to decommissioned `localhost:8080` local Hub |
| bug-113 | minor | PR-2 | `list_available_peers` advertised on MCP surface but uncallable — prune the stale advertiser + doc currency |
| bug-112 | minor | PR-3 | task-144 phantom `Pending actions: 2`; stale-task admin gap |
| bug-109 | major | PR-4 | non-hub CI cells masked structural debt — claude-plugin e2e harness dead, opencode-plugin baseline broken |

**Sequencing (thread-608, concurred):** PR-1 first (de-risk the flaky CI cell so
it doesn't red-herring PRs 2-4) → PR-2 → PR-3 → PR-4. bug-109 was originally
slated for its own mission, but the Director disposed opencode-plugin RETAINED
(2026-05-22), collapsing its only Director-strategic fork — so it folds back
into the batch as PR-4. The PolicyLoopbackHub repair-vs-replace fork is settled
bilaterally with the architect at PR-4 scoping.

**PR cadence:** apnex-org repo → PR-flow. Engineer opens each PR; architect
cross-approves (Hub thread + `gh pr review --approve`) and merges on green CI.

## PR-1 — bug-110 (vitest teardown race)

**Branch:** `agent-greg/bug-110-vitest-teardown-race` (off `origin/main @ a3252eb`)

### Root cause (confirmed in code — refines the bug's attribution)

bug-110 names `substrate-counter.race.test.ts` as "leaves a pg client open."
Code-read finding: that test does NOT leak — it already calls `substrate.close()`
in `afterAll`. The real root cause is broader and structural:

**pg's documented contract** — a `Pool`/`Client` with NO `'error'` listener turns
a backend error on an *idle* connection into an UNCAUGHT exception that crashes
the process. The hub substrate constructed its pg resources WITHOUT that handler
at 4 long-lived sites:

- `postgres-substrate.ts:42` — substrate `Pool`
- `postgres-substrate.ts:232` — `watch()` dedicated LISTEN `Client`
- `schema-reconciler.ts:67` — reconciler `Pool`
- `token-store.ts:56` — token-store `Pool`

(`migration-runner.ts:43` — `Client` — EXCLUDED: provably short-lived, always
`client.end()`-ed in `finally` before the function returns; cannot be open at
teardown.)

In CI a postgres testcontainer's `container.stop()` racing the pool's own
teardown delivers a `57P01` to a still-idle connection → uncaught exception →
`vitest (hub)` exits 1 even though all tests pass (tripped #236 + #237). Same gap
in production: a postgres failover/restart would crash the Hub process.

### Fix (shipped in PR-1)

- New `src/storage-substrate/pg-error-handler.ts` — `attachPgErrorHandler(emitter,
  label)`: the canonical pg `'error'` handler (log non-fatal, don't crash). DRY
  across the 4 sites.
- Applied at all 4 pg-resource sites above.
- `HubStorageSubstrate` interface — `close(): Promise<void>` promoted to the
  interface (was an implementation-only method reached via an `as unknown` cast).
  `MemoryStorageSubstrate.close()` added as a no-op (no connections).
- `substrate-counter.race.test.ts` `afterAll` — `await substrate.close()`
  (typed; no cast, no optional-chain that silently no-ops a missing teardown).
- Regression guard: `__tests__/pg-error-handler.test.ts` — deterministic
  (no container) — proves a post-attach `'error'` is handled, not thrown.

### Verification

- `tsc --noEmit` clean (no interface-fake breakage).
- Full hub suite green: 114 files passed / 1 skipped, 1496 tests passed / 7
  skipped (was 113 / 1493 pre-PR; +1 file +3 tests = the new helper test).
- substrate subset (25 testcontainer files) green ×16.
- Note: the rare flake did NOT reproduce locally pre-fix (~36 runs); the fix is
  mechanically certain (the missing handler is pg's documented crash contract)
  and the unit test is the dispositive deterministic proof.

## PR-2 — bug-111 + bug-113 (+ bug-109 companion comment-refs)

**Branch:** `agent-greg/bug-111-113-agent-state-diagnostics` (off `origin/main @ 5b48893`)

### bug-111 — get-agents.sh Hub-URL resolution

`scripts/local/get-agents.sh` hardcoded `DEFAULT_HOST="http://localhost:8080"` —
the local Hub decommissioned at mission-86 W5.4. Fix: resolve the Hub URL at
runtime — `--host` flag > `HUB_URL` env > `.ois/adapter-config.json` `hubUrl`
(trailing `/mcp` normalised off; `call_get_agents` re-appends it). No hardcoded
default; an unresolved URL is a hard error (exit 2). **Verified live** — the
script resolved the cloud Hub URL from adapter-config and rendered the agent
table (greg + lily `online_idle`).

### bug-113 — list_available_peers advertised-but-uncallable

Locate step (architect's ListTools-vs-router hypothesis): the Hub builds its
`tools/list` directly from the router via `bindRouterToMcp` — no separate
advertised-schema list. **Verified against the live Hub**: `tools/list` returns
71 tools, `list_available_peers` absent, `get_agents` present. The Hub side is
clean — idea-252 §2's retirement is fully live.

The stale advertiser is the **network-adapter `.ois/tool-catalog.json` cache** —
a gitignored per-WORK_DIR snapshot (fetched 2026-04-22, `hubVersion 1.0.0`, 58
tools, still listing `list_available_peers`). Root cause: `tool-catalog-cache.ts`
invalidates on `hubVersion` mismatch ONLY ("the catalog is static between Hub
deploys" — a false assumption); the Hub stayed `1.0.0` through a month of
tool-surface change (58→71 tools + the idea-252 retirement), so the cache never
invalidated.

- **part-1** — NOT a repo-source change. The stale cache is a local artifact; it
  regenerates on a clean re-fetch. The cache-invalidation design gap
  (version-only) is surfaced to the architect — recommend Hub-version-bump
  discipline on tool-surface changes (lightest fix), or a cache-hardening
  follow-on (TTL / tool-set fingerprint).
- **part-2** — doc currency: `all-schemas.ts:37` index-comment cite updated
  (`list_available_peers` → `get_agents`). `multi-env-operator-setup.md` already
  carries the idea-252 replacement note. Historical design/audit/decision docs
  left as-is (they record history, not current guidance). Architect did the
  `reference_get_agents_canonical_diagnostic` memory.

### bug-109 companion — 3 stale comment-refs

- `hub/src/policy/agent-projection.ts` — ref to removed
  `scripts/migrate-canonical-envelope-state.ts` → comment reworded.
- `.gitignore` — ref to removed `scripts/state-sync.sh` + deleted GCS → comment
  reworded.
- `packages/storage-provider` local-fs `state-backup.sh` ref — already gone:
  `local-fs.ts` itself was deleted at mission-84 W4 (LocalFsStorageProvider
  retirement); the stale comment died with its file. No edit.

### Verification
- `tsc --noEmit` clean (agent-projection.ts + all-schemas.ts are comment-only).
- get-agents.sh verified live against the cloud Hub.

## PR-3 — bug-112 (create_review backfill on an unreviewed completed task)

**Branch:** `agent-greg/bug-112-create-review-completed-fix` (off `origin/main @ 7b91c5d`)

### Scoping saga — the (a)/(b) fork was on the wrong axis

bug-112's filing framed the task-144 phantom as "stuck `enqueued` items in the
pending-actions queue", and the architect's directional fork — (a) new
force-close tool vs (b) document the `drain → prune` route — inherited that
premise. Scoping verified drain→prune *as a queue operation* was clean (no
re-dispatch, dispatchType+entityRef-scopable, idempotent) → recommended (b),
architect confirmed (b) as a pure-doc runbook.

**STOP at PR-3 build time:** reading `get_pending_actions`'s implementation to
write the runbook revealed the whole axis was wrong. `get_pending_actions.
totalPending` is computed from **task / proposal / thread entity scans, not the
pending-action queue** (`system-policy.ts` — `unreadReports` + `unreviewedTasks`
filters over `task.listTasks()`). drain→prune mutates the queue — a different
store — so it cannot move `totalPending`. The (b) runbook would not have closed
bug-112; its acceptance test would have failed. Surfaced to the architect before
any artifact shipped; architect cross-checked task-144 live (`status: completed`,
`report` non-null, `reviewAssessment: null`, `reviewRef: null`) and re-disposed.

### Root cause (verified)

task-144 was force-`completed` via a gsutil edit (2026-04-18, FSM-bypassed) — it
never travelled `in_review → completed` through `submitReview`, so
`reviewAssessment` was never written. `get_pending_actions` counts a task with a
terminal status + `report != null` + `!reviewAssessment` under BOTH
`unreadReports` and `unreviewedTasks` → `totalPending += 2` (the phantom
"Pending actions: 2"). `create_review(approved)` on a `completed` task hit a
pure no-op idempotency branch (`review-policy.ts:42-58`) — it never called
`submitReview` (the only `reviewAssessment` writer) — so there was no path to
clear it.

### Fix (Option 1 — architect re-disposed)

- `review-policy.ts` — `create_review`'s `completed`-task branch now
  distinguishes "genuinely already reviewed" (`reviewAssessment` present →
  preserve the idempotent no-op) from "completed but never reviewed"
  (`!reviewAssessment` → retroactive backfill via `submitReview`). The backfill
  records `reviewAssessment` + `reviewRef`; `"approved"` re-asserts
  `status: completed` (identity write — no transition); deliberately NO dispatch
  / no `task_completed` cascade / no triggers (bookkeeping backfill on an
  already-terminal task).
- **Class scope — `completed`-only, justified** (architect review point 1): the
  silent-no-op blind spot is structurally `completed`-only — `create_review`'s
  no-op branch is `if (task.status === "completed")`. `failed` / `reported_*` /
  `escalated` tasks don't reach a no-op branch; they hit the `isValidTransition`
  FSM-guard and hard-error (a structurally different defect, not a silent
  no-op). The architect's observed `totalPending: 2` (both task-144) confirms
  `completed` is the only live phantom class — no `failed`/`reported_*`
  instances. A `failed`/`reported_*` analog, if it ever arises, is a separate
  fix (idea-78 territory).
- `test-utils.ts` — `createTestContext` now exposes the backing `substrate` so
  tests can seed entity state the public store API cannot construct (the
  `completed` + no-`reviewAssessment` shape).
- Regression test `test/bug-112-create-review-completed-backfill.test.ts` —
  exercises the fix THROUGH the real `get_pending_actions` (architect review
  point 2): asserts the seeded task drops from `unreadReports` +
  `unreviewedTasks` and `totalPending` goes 2 → 0; plus an idempotency case
  (second `create_review` is a no-op, does not overwrite the first assessment).

### Verification
- `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- Full hub suite green: 115 files / 1498 tests (was 114 / 1496; +1 file +2 tests
  = the new bug-112 regression test).

### Closure
- Option 1 is hub/src → folds into bug-110's Hub-redeploy gate. bug-112's
  acceptance test (`create_review(task-144, approved)` → task-144 drops from
  `get_pending_actions`) runs **post-redeploy**; bug-112 closes at the redeploy
  gate alongside bug-110. PR-merged ≠ bug-closed.
- idea-78 (broad Task-FSM governance) stays a separate audited triage item;
  bug-112's filing cross-links it.

## Session log

### 2026-05-22 AM AEST — batch picked up; PR-1 implemented + merged

- thread-608: architect surfaced the 5-bug batch + proposed grouping. Confirmed
  grouping/sequencing with refinements (PR-2 one-PR; bug-113 hub-side already
  done at idea-252 §2; PR-3 directional (a)-new-tool vs (b)-document-drain→prune;
  bug-109 → own mission). Architect concurred all.
- PR-1 root-caused, implemented, verified, surfaced as #238. Architect
  cross-approved + merged to main @ `5b48893`. bug-110 reattributed minor→major
  (production-failover-crash finding); stays open until the Hub redeploy gate.

### 2026-05-22 AM AEST — PR-2 implemented

- bug-109 disposition changed: Director retained opencode-plugin → bug-109 folds
  back as PR-4 (no separate mission).
- PR-2 implemented (above): get-agents.sh Hub-URL resolution (verified live);
  bug-113 located (stale adapter cache, not a repo defect — surfaced); 2 of 3
  bug-109 companion comment-refs reworded (3rd already gone). Surfaced as #239;
  architect cross-approved + merged to main @ `7b91c5d`. bug-114 filed for the
  cache-invalidation design gap.

### 2026-05-22 — PR-3 scoping STOP + re-disposition

- PR-3 scoped: located idea-78 (broad stale-task-admin idea); verified
  drain→prune; recommended (b); architect confirmed (b) as a pure-doc runbook.
- STOP at build time — reading `get_pending_actions` showed the (a)/(b) fork's
  shared premise ("queue problem") was wrong; surfaced with code evidence.
- Architect re-disposed to Option 1 (`create_review` backfill). PR-3 re-shaped
  to the policy fix + regression test; the runbook is dropped. Branch cut off
  `origin/main @ 7b91c5d`. Implemented + verified (full suite 115/1498 green).
  NEXT: commit + push + open PR-3 + surface on thread-608.
